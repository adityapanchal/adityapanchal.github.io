      This project was selected to compete in Prakalpa Event (2018). It was meant
      to compete in the software theme-based category (Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence). This project fetched us consolation prize. <br>
      <hl>What does this program do?</hl><br>
      This program gives suggestions to users for different ingredients to add
      to their existing list of ingredients.<br>
      <hl>How does the program do that?</hl><br>
      The program is initially trained with the database of recipes. These
      recipes may not belong to the same cuisine. Also the program clusters
      ingredients as per cuisines as a secondary feature.<br>
      <u style="color: #ffffff;">The Machine Learning Part:</u><br>
      The program reads each recipe and prepares a table for its own usage which
      notes down the frequency of the occurrence of each pair of ingredients
      appearing in those recipes. The noting of frequency also takes into
      account a weightage factor-the rating of the recipe. If the recipe has
      higher rating the frequency noted is higher. This helps to prioritise each
      combinations which is more likely to taste good together. <br>
      <u style="color: #ffffff;">The database part:</u><br>
      No external libraries were used. All the file handling was done using
      "open()" function which is built-in in python3. The databases used for
      training as well as storing computed values was done using CSV files. The
      program was optimised for handling huge databases by modifying the program
      to read each file line by line. <br>
      <hl>Project Outcome/result:</hl><br>
      The program was created with a CLI interface and was initially meant to be
      used as an API.
      The program was tested and trained with a database of 20,000 recipes which
      was obtained from the internet (source unknown). The program was tested by
      giving sushi as an input and the output was compared with an existing
      asian sushi recipe. Most of the ingredients mentioned in the recipe were
      present in the top 10 recommendations from the program output. <br>
      <hl>Ideas for modification:</hl>
      The API like program can be supported with the server program and can have
      its own app as well as website/page as a GUI for users.
